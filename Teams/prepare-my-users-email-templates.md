# <a name="facilitate-user-adoption-of-your-new-online-phone-system"></a>Facilitare l'adozione di un nuovo sistema telefonico online

Un telefono può essere la linea di vita di un utente. Il passaggio da un sistema telefonico tradizionale a un sistema telefonico online rappresenta un cambiamento significativo nel modo in cui gli utenti lavorano e possono influire negativamente sulla produttività. Il tempo necessario per informare, guidare e supportare gli utenti tramite questo cambiamento può aiutare a garantire un'esperienza utente positiva e a massimizzare il rendimento degli investimenti.

Questo articolo contiene i modelli di posta elettronica personalizzabili per informare gli utenti sul nuovo sistema telefonico. Personalizzare e inviare i messaggi di posta elettronica appropriati per allinearsi alla distribuzione vocale specifica. Abbiamo usato le parentesi quadre per indicare le sezioni per semplificare la personalizzazione, ma ti consigliamo di aggiungere la messaggistica specifica dell'organizzazione per rendere l'annuncio più pertinente per gli utenti. Se applicabile per la distribuzione, Sostituisci tutti i riferimenti a "Teams" con "Skype for business".

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone
```

Corpo del messaggio di posta elettronica:

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can’t be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it’s easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can’t be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use Microsoft Teams as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using Teams as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

When will phone calling be available?

ensure you have everything you need to get started. Phone capabilities will be
enabled on <INSERT DATE>, but you can start preparing today.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your new phone system is live
```

Corpo del messaggio di posta elettronica:

```
Welcome to your new phone system. Your Microsoft Teams application
has been enabled with phone calling capabilities. You should now see a dial pad
tab on your client, enabling you to make outgoing calls and listen to
your voicemail. When a call comes in, you'll receive an alert, just like you
would for an instant message. Just select the alert to answer the call – it’s
that easy!

CALL TO ACTION

*  Plug in your headset, go to the Calls tab, and either
   call a contact or use the dial pad to make a call. 

*  Start a chat, and escalate it to a call.

With the launch of phone calling capabilities in Teams, we'll be
recycling your old phone, allowing for more real estate on your desk.
