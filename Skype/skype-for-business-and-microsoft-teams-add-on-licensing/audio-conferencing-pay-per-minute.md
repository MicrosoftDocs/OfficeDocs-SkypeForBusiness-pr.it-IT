Whereas the Audio Conferencing per-user license offer includes dial-in usage and some dial-out usage, Audio Conferencing pay-per-minute **allows you to pay for all of your Audio Conferencing usage on a per-minute basis without paying for a per-user monthly license**. With this, all dial-in and dial-out calls will be charged on a per-minute basis, including:
  
- Inbound calls to toll Audio Conferencing numbers of your organization.
    
- Inbound calls to toll-free Audio Conferencing numbers of your organization.
    
- Outbound calls placed to external phone numbers from within a meeting of your organization.
    
> [!NOTE]
> You can find the dial-in and dial-out rates associated to these types of calls by reviewing the **See rates for where you want to call section** in[Audio Conferencing](https://products.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business/pstn-conferencing).
