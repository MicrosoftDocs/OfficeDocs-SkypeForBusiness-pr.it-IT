The first step in creating a more secure unified communications system was to design threat models and test each feature as it was designed. Multiple security-related improvements were built into the coding process and practices. Build-time tools detect buffer overruns and other potential security threats before the code is checked in to the final product. Of course, it is impossible to design against all unknown security threats. No system can guarantee complete security. However, because product development embraced secure design principles from the start, Skype for Business Online incorporates industry standard security technologies as a fundamental part of its architecture.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p102">Skype for Business Online is designed and developed in compliance with the Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Security Development Lifecycle (SDL), which is described at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/default.aspx.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p104">Una chiave è un codice segreto o un numero usato per crittografare, decrittografare o convalidare le informazioni segrete. Esistono due chiavi riservate in uso nell'infrastruttura a chiave pubblica (PKI) che deve essere considerata: la chiave privata che contiene ogni proprietario di certificato e la chiave di sessione che viene usata dopo un riuscito scambio di identificazioni e chiavi di sessione da parte dei partner di comunicazione. Un attacco con chiave compromessa si verifica quando l'aggressore determina la chiave privata o la chiave di sessione. Quando l'aggressore riesce a determinare la chiave, l'aggressore può usare la chiave per decrittografare i dati crittografati senza la conoscenza del mittente.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p104">A key is a secret code or number that is used to encrypt, decrypt, or validate secret information. There are two sensitive keys in use in public key infrastructure (PKI) that must be considered: the private key that each certificate holder has and the session key that is used after a successful identification and session key exchange by the communicating partners. A compromised-key attack occurs when the attacker determines the private key or the session key. When the attacker is successful in determining the key, the attacker can use the key to decrypt encrypted data without the knowledge of the sender.</span></span>

### <a name="eavesdropping"></a><span data-ttu-id="db593-134">Intercettazione</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-134">Eavesdropping</span></span>
<span data-ttu-id="db593-p107">Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic. This is also called sniffing or snooping. If the traffic is in plain text, the attacker can read the traffic when the attacker gains access to the path. An example is an attack performed by controlling a router on the data path.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p107">Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic.

An example is an attack performed by controlling a router on the data path.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked. TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. This does not prevent eavesdropping, but the attacker cannot read the traffic unless the encryption is broken.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p108">SfBO uses mutual TLS (MTLS) for server communications within O365 and TLS from clients to the service, rendering this attack very difficult to impossible to achieve within the time period in which a given conversation could be attacked.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p109">Il protocollo TURN viene usato per scopi multimediali in tempo reale. Il protocollo TURN non obbliga il traffico a essere crittografato e le informazioni che sta inviando sono protette dall'integrità dei messaggi. Anche se è aperto alle intercettazioni, le informazioni che invia (ovvero indirizzi IP e porta) possono essere estratte direttamente semplicemente esaminando gli indirizzi di origine e di destinazione dei pacchetti. Il servizio SfBO garantisce che i dati siano validi controllando l'integrità del messaggio usando la chiave derivata da alcuni elementi, tra cui una password di attivazione, che non viene mai inviata in testo non crittografato. SRTP viene usato per il traffico multimediale ed è anche crittografato.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p109">The TURN protocol is used for real time media purposes. The TURN protocol does not mandate the traffic to be encrypted and the information that it is sending is protected by message integrity. Although it is open to eavesdropping, the information it is sending (that is, IP addresses and port) can be extracted directly by simply looking at the source and destination addresses of the packets. The SfBO service ensures that the data is valid by checking the Message Integrity of the message using the key derived from a few items including a TURN password, which is never sent in clear text. SRTP is used for media traffic and is also encrypted.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so. A successful attack allows the attacker to operate as if the attacker is the entity normally identified by the IP address. Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p110">Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component without being authorized to do so.

Within the context of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, this situation comes into play only if an administrator has done both of the following:</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic. Using TLS prevents an attacker from performing IP address spoofing on a specific connection (for example, mutual TLS connections). But an attacker could still spoof the address of the DNS server that SfBO uses. However, because authentication in SfBO is performed with certificates, an attacker would not have a valid certificate required to spoof one of the parties in the communication.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p111">This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, as TLS authenticates all parties and encrypts all traffic.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it on to the intended recipient. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. This can happen if an attacker can modify Active Directory Domain Services to add his or her server as a trusted server or modify Domain Name System (DNS) to get clients to connect through the attacker on their way to the server.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p112">A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attacker’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-162">Un attacco man-in-the-middle può verificarsi anche con il traffico multimediale tra due client, tranne che in SfBO point-to-point audio, video e flussi di condivisione delle applicazioni sono crittografati con SRTP, utilizzando chiavi crittografiche negoziate tra i peer tramite SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) su TLS.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-162">A man-in-the-middle attack can also occur with media traffic between two clients, except that in SfBO point-to-point audio, video, and application sharing streams are encrypted with SRTP, using cryptographic keys that are negotiated between the peers using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over TLS.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes. SfBO uses SRTP in conjunction with a secure signaling protocol that protects transmissions from replay attacks by enabling the receiver to maintain an index of already received RTP packets and compare each new packet with those already listed in the index.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p113">A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmission between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious purposes.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p115">Un virus è un'unità di codice il cui scopo è quello di riprodurre altre unità di codice simili. Per il lavoro, un virus necessita di un host, ad esempio un file, un messaggio di posta elettronica o un programma. Come un virus, un worm è un'unità di codice codificata per riprodurre altre unità di codice simili, ma che diversamente da un virus non ha bisogno di un host. I virus e i worm vengono visualizzati principalmente durante i trasferimenti di file tra client o quando gli URL vengono inviati da altri utenti. Se un virus si trova nel computer, può, ad esempio, usare la propria identità e inviare messaggi istantanei per conto dell'utente. Le procedure consigliate per la sicurezza dei client standard, ad esempio la ricerca periodica di virus, possono mitigare questo problema.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p115">A virus is a unit of code whose purpose is to reproduce additional, similar code units. To work, a virus needs a host, such as a file, email, or program. Like a virus, a worm is a unit of code that is coded to reproduce additional, similar code units, but that unlike a virus does not need a host. Viruses and worms primarily show up during file transfers between clients or when URLs are sent from other users. If a virus is on your computer, it can, for example, use your identity and send instant messages on your behalf. Standard client security best practices such as periodically scanning for viruses can mitigate this issue.</span></span>

The Windows Server public key infrastructure (PKI) provides the infrastructure for establishing and validating this chain of trust. Certificates are digital IDs. They identify a server by name and specify its properties. To ensure that the information on a certificate is valid, the certificate must be issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by clients or other servers that connect to the server. If the server connects only with other clients and servers on a private network, the CA can be an enterprise CA. If the server interacts with entities outside the private network, a public CA might be required.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p122">SfBO service relies on certificates for server authentication and to establish a chain of trust between clients and servers and among the different server roles.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p126">TLS and MTLS protocols provide encrypted communications and endpoint authentication on the Internet.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect. On a TLS connection, the client requests a valid certificate from the server. To be valid, the certificate must have been issued by a CA that is also trusted by the client and the DNS name of the server must match the DNS name on the certificate. If the certificate is valid, the client uses the public key in the certificate to encrypt the symmetric encryption keys to be used for the communication, so only the original owner of the certificate can use its private key to decrypt the contents of the communication. The resulting connection is trusted and from that point is not challenged by other trusted servers or clients. Within this context, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as used with Web services can be associated as TLS-based.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p127">TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the SfBO servers to which they connect.

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p142">Le porte UDP 3478-3481 e TCP 443 vengono usate dai client per richiedere il servizio dall'A/V Edge service. Un client usa queste due porte per allocare le porte UDP e TCP rispettivamente per la parte remota a cui connettersi. Per accedere al servizio A/V Edge, è necessario che il client abbia prima stabilito una sessione di segnalazione SIP autenticata con SfBO registrar per ottenere le credenziali di autenticazione del servizio Edge/V. Questi valori vengono inviati attraverso il canale di segnalazione protetto da TLS e vengono generati dal computer per mitigare gli attacchi del dizionario. I client possono quindi usare queste credenziali per l'autenticazione del digest con l'a/V Edge service per allocare le porte da usare in una sessione multimediale. Una richiesta di assegnazione iniziale viene inviata dal client e ha risposto con un messaggio di 401/V. Il client invia una seconda assegnazione che contiene il nome utente e un hash HMAC (hash Message Authentication Code) del nome utente e del parametro nonce.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p142">The UDP 3478-3481 and TCP 443 ports are used by clients to request service from the A/V Edge service. A client uses these two ports to allocate UDP and TCP ports respectively for the remote party to connect to. To access the A/V Edge service, the client must first have established an authenticated SIP signaling session with SfBO registrar to obtain A/V Edge service authentication credentials. These values are sent across the TLS-protected signaling channel and are computer generated to mitigate against dictionary attacks. Clients can then use these credentials for digest authentication with the A/V Edge service to allocate ports for use in a media session. An initial allocate request is sent from the client and responded with a 401 nonce/challenge message from the A/V Edge service. The client sends a second allocate containing the user name and a Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC) hash of the user name and nonce.</span></span> 

<span data-ttu-id="db593-p143">A sequence number mechanism is also in place to prevent replay attacks. The server calculates the expected HMAC based on its own knowledge of the user name and password and if the HMAC values match, the allocate procedure is carried out. Otherwise, the packet is dropped. This same HMAC mechanism is also applied to subsequent messages within this call session. The lifetime of this user name/password value is a maximum of eight hours at which time the client reacquires a new user name/password for subsequent calls.</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="db593-p143">A sequence number mechanism is also in place to prevent replay attacks.

Because the A/V Edge service is the sole process using these ports, the size of the port range does not indicate the potential surface of attack. Good security practice is to always minimize the total number of listening ports by not running unnecessary network services. If a network service is not running, it is not exploitable by a remote attacker and the surface of attack of the host computer is reduced. However, within a single service, reducing the number of ports does not provide the same benefit. The A/V Edge service software is no more exposed to attack with 10,000 ports open as it is with 10.
